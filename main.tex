\textbf{KEYWORDS:} Keyword 1, Keyword 2 and Keyword 3. You can include a maximum of 6 keywords for indexing purposes (spaced by commas). Keywords are single words or short phrases describing the main concepts/topics covered in the paper. Sometimes only 2 or 3 keywords will suffice, but definitely no more than six.\\


\section{INTRODUCTION}

Consumers are the essence of any business. They come at the top of the development process of every business./cite(Witek2020). The phrase customer is king is valid in every venture across the globe as they make or break a business. The importance given to the customers makes it all the more crucial to understand their psyche and behaviour as that directly impacts the firms' profit and longevity. 


It's no surprise that environmental contamination is at its peak currently /cite(RaviVyas2023). An enormous bulk of this contamination comes from waste packaging. Due to the growing age of the internet, the social and environmental awareness of consumers is growing rapidly \cite{Groening2018}. People care more about the state of the world now than ever before. 

Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities were made mandatory in April 2014 under the Companies Act 2013. The main aim of this modification by the Government of India was to inculcate a sense of social consciousness in the firms. The increase in environmental degradation made it all the more vital for the firms to make small changes to influence society at large, which led to the popularity of a new term known as "Green Marketing". Green Marketing came into emergence in the 1980s. It simply means the promotion, distribution, and packaging of products and services by focusing on their sustainability and ecological benefits. 

Green Marketing comes with its own set of pros and cons but the perspective matters. Looking from a broader outlook, Green Marketing has more pros than drawbacks. The positive effect it has on the environment in the long run, a better brand image, and appeal to environmentally conscious customers. It becomes crucial for organizations and businesses to pay more attention to green marketing as it plays a huge role from a competitive perspective as well. Consumers would naturally opt for environment-friendly products \cite{Groening2018}


\subsection{Green Packaging}

Green packaging is a subset of green marketing. It refers to the usage of eco-friendly packaging instead of plastics and non-biodegradable items. Ministry of Food Processing Industries published a focus paper, \cite{MOFPI2023} which gave insights on sustainable packaging. Some of the major benefits of green packaging mentioned in the paper were minimizing carbon footprint, waste reduction, and improvement in brand image. Food, normally requires plenty of packaging which in turn requires excessive materials. Paper packaging, biodegradable plastics, and compostable plastics are some of the common green packaging products.



\begin{itemize}
    \item If you want to list bullet points you can do so;
    \item This is the second point;
    \item This is a third bullet point;
    \item A fourth bullet point;
    \item But you can.
\end{itemize}   

After a list you must leave a single blank line and remember to add the indent if you are starting a new paragraph.

\subsection{Another sub-heading}

You can have as many sub-headings in a section as you want to. Note that sub-headings have a 6pt spacing after them rather than a blank line but they are preceded by a blank line. The number of sections and sub-sections is up to you, as are the titles of each of them and this will be driven by the content of your report.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Logistic Regression}

Logistic regression is a supervised learning technique used for classification problems. It helps in classifying data into classes on the basis of independent variables. The dependent (target) variable is binary in nature that is it has two outcomes. 
Logistic regression makes the use of sigmoid function which helps in the transformation of any real-valued number into a number between 0 and 1. Figure \ref{sigmoid} shows an S-shaped graph of a sigmoid function. 


\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=6.6cm]{figures/image.png}
\caption{Sigmoid Function}
\label{sigmoid}
\end{figure}

(\ref{sigmoid_eq}) shows the equation of a sigmoid function where x is any real-valued number which needs to be converted into a number between 0 and 1

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
\label{sigmoid_eq}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Data}
\subsubsection{Data Collection}

The data is stimulated using Python and AI tools. An overview of the variables considered in the data was taken by going through different research papers and articles. 

\subsubsection{Summary}
The data consists of the following variables
\begin{itemize}

    \item Income 
    \item Age 
    \item Gender 
    \item Price of the product
    \item Type of product
    \item Green packaging (Yes/No)
    \item Purchase Decision (Yes/No)
\end{itemize}

Whether the customer purchased the product or not is the dependent variable and the rest are independent variables. 

\subsection{How to include equations, figures and tables?}

Some of us like to include a formula or two and these should be referred to in the test in the form equation 1. You must type in equations using the equation editor and all symbols should be explained within the text of your manuscript. However you may prefer to include a separate section detailing all nomenclature. Never paste equations in from a paper or other source. Leave a blank line before and after the equation:


where $x$ is a number; $a$, $b$, and $c$ are other numbers.

\begin{equation}
BCP = 176R+28G+46B
\end{equation}

where, $BCP$, $R$, $G$ and $B$ are also useful numbers.

Figure \ref{fig_regression} shows a graph.  Figures / diagrams / photos are to be centred, with the reference and caption printed below the figure. The lettering used in the illustrations should be easily legible.  Illustrations are to be referred to as figures, and must be quoted in the text. One blank line should be left between the figure caption and the next paragraph. Please ensure that all figures are of the highest quality. Keep figures as simple as possible. Avoid excessive notes. Photographs must have a resolution of at least 300 dpi. The use of colour is allowed on figures. Note that the test does not wrap around the figure but if you do not like the wasted space then it is acceptable to put two figures side by side but they must be e.g. a ‘Figure \ref{fig_bridge1}’ and ‘Figure \ref{fig_bridge2}’ and not ‘Figure 1’ and ‘Figure 2’. See the example given as Figure \ref{fig_twobridges}. However all figures must be as close as possible to the location where they are first referred to in the text. The figure is also not surrounded by an unnecessary box/border. Remove this when inserting figures from MS Excel.

\section{NEXT HEADING}

Table \ref{tab_materials} contains something interesting. For tables make sure that you use 8 point Times New Roman for ALL the text in the Tables (apart from the caption). Please be consistent throughout your manuscript. Leave one blank line before the table title, another blank line after the title and one blank line after the table. Table titles must be above the table. As with figures the use of color is acceptable in tables. Make sure that the table does not run across multiple pages. If it does then have a repeat of the table caption with the word ‘continued’ in brackets after it.


\begin{table}[h]
\begin{center}
\caption{Summary of the database (note that table captions go ABOVE THE TABLE)}
\begin{tabular}{ |l|c|l| }
\hline
 \textbf{Column heading} & \textbf{Column heading}    & \textbf{Column heading} \\ \hline 
 Table Text     & 10     & Falling head permeameter \\  \hline 
 Concrete       & 2      & Strong \\ \hline 
 Steel          & 1      & Stronger \\ \hline 
 Timber         & 3      & Weak \\ 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab_materials}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section{SUMMARY}

The conclusions to be drawn from this work are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 	This is a great template
\end{itemize}


At the end of the reference list no more than 15 pages should be in your ENTIRE document (including the cover sheet). Do check else a penalty will be applied!  (For students enrolled in CENGM0080 your document including the cover sheet must be no longer than 20 pages using this template).

Remember you need to submit your research paper as a PDF document! Make sure you check that all the fonts, figures and text is preserved in the layout you intend when PDF conversion is done!
