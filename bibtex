Consumers are very selective about the product or service they choose to meet their demands in this era of digitization. They are beginning to care about their health and are inclined to purchase and use environmentally friendly products. Products and services that promote environmental sustainability are the foundation of successful businesses. Specialty units are concentrating their efforts on green bundling as consumers become more aware about the environment. The goal of this article is to understand how consumers feel about green packaging for a sustainable climate. FMCG products touch every aspect of human existence. All groups of the public spend a significant amount of their time on these things, and they also account for a sizable portion of their income. Additionally, the sector makes a considerable contribution to the Indian economy. This industry has grown dramatically in recent years; in fact, it kept expanding even as the economy was in a slump. This article conducts experimental research on Indian customers’ attitudes on preserving the environment and promoting social welfare in the country’s FMCG market as a whole. In India, a review was established and controlled. 200 Indian consumers in total responded to the poll. The review’s conclusions would help the government better understand how consumers behave in light of their current situation and design more effective environmental measures.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, number={9s(2)}, journal={Journal for ReAttach Therapy and Developmental Diversities}, author={Ravi Vyas, Chaudhary Saket Kumar, Shaifali Garg, Priyanka Sikarwar, Arif Hasan, Sandeep Raghuwanshi}, year={2023}, month={Aug.}, pages={169–181} }
